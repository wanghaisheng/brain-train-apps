User complaints about brain training apps, particularly highlighted on Reddit, include:

- **False Advertising**: Lumosity has been a focal point, with users referencing a $2 million fine by the Federal Trade Commission for making unsubstantiated claims about improving cognitive functions like ADHD and Alzheimer's ([Is Lumosity a scam? I think it might be](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/22bgw5/is_lumosity_a_scam_i_think_it_might_be/)). Reddit discussions often label such claims as misleading, with users feeling apps overpromise on general intelligence gains.
  
- **Subscription Cancellation Issues**: Several Reddit posts mention difficulties in cancelling subscriptions, especially for Lumosity and Peak. For instance, a thread on r/androidapps noted, "Both apps seem to make it difficult to cancel subscription" ([What has your experience been with Lumosity and/or Elevate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/g388l5/what_has_your_experience_been_with_lumosity_andor/)).

- **Questionable Effectiveness**: Many users express skepticism about the apps' ability to improve general cognitive skills, with comments like, "Those games neither train your brain nor make your memory improved. Just like any other game, you only get better on that specific game" ([What are some good brain-training-style apps to help improve memory and memorisation skills?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/9wypmo/what_are_some_good_braintrainingstyle_apps_to/)). This sentiment is echoed across multiple threads, with users citing a lack of transfer to real-world tasks.

On X, complaints are less detailed, with one notable post mentioning poor customer support for Lumosity: "@LumozOrg Furthermore, the response times from the support team are slow, and their replies are often unhelpful and impersonal. This has been the worst customer support experience I have ever had" ([X post](https://x.com/maru_crypton/status/1897943532289265942)).

#### Pros
The pros of brain training apps, as discussed on Reddit and X, include:

- **Fun and Engaging**: Users frequently describe these apps as enjoyable, with comments like, "It's a really fun game that makes you want to try harder than your last result in a game" ([Peak Brain Training - Level Up Your Brain!](https://www.peak.net/)). X posts also promote apps like Peak for their "fun games and exercises designed to improve memory, focus, and problem-solving skills" ([X post](https://x.com/codedailyML/status/1897989023609782652)).

- **Specific Skill Improvement**: Some users report improvements in targeted skills, such as memory or attention, within the app's context. For example, a Reddit user noted, "NeuroNation: Best of the bunch. Scales quickly to your skill level. I already seem to be improving my short-term memory" ([Brain Training Apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/cognitiveTesting/comments/11mvrki/brain_training_apps/)). Another mentioned, "Love Elevate and Peak. Thanks for the tip on NeuroNation!" ([Any good brain training apps ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1386bgq/any_good_brain_training_apps/)).

#### Cons
The cons, as identified from user discussions, are:

- **Lack of Transfer to Real-World Scenarios**: A recurring theme is that improvements may not extend beyond the app. Reddit users often state, "Brain-training does not seem to make you smarter, but will make you better at whatever task you perform" ([Are there any "Brain Training" games without the subscription model?](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/5czpo6/are_there_any_brain_training_games_without_the/)). This is supported by expert opinions shared in threads, suggesting limited real-world impact.

- **Insufficient Scientific Evidence**: Many users and experts on Reddit question the scientific backing, with comments like, "There’s no evidence base on their effectiveness (e.g., Lumosity)" ([Brain exercises/training/etc?](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/8yitny/brain_exercisestrainingetc/)).
